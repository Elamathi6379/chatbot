🤖 NLP-Based Chatbot using Python
This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Python libraries like NLTK or spaCy. The chatbot can understand user inputs and respond to common queries using pattern matching, keyword extraction, and basic intent recognition.

✅ Features
Understands user input in natural language

Responds to greetings, FAQs, and basic small talk

Uses NLP techniques: tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging

Lightweight and easy to customize

Built using NLTK or spaCy (switchable)

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NLTK and/or spaCy

Regex (for pattern matching)

Optional: Flask or Streamlit (for UI)

🚀 How to Run
To start the chatbot in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
Then interact with the bot by typing your questions.

Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
You: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?
🧠 How It Works
Input is tokenized and normalized

Keywords or intents are extracted using simple rule-based logic or intent JSON

A response is selected based on predefined rules or a small decision tree

✏️ Customization
You can edit or extend the chatbot's capabilities by:

Modifying intent patterns in intents.json

Adding new rules in chatbot.py

Plugging in a trained model for more advanced responses
